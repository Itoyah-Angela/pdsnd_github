### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data

### Description
 In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### USE GUIDE:
  - User would be requested to input any of the three major city to  analyse it's data
  - User would be requested to specity filter as needed for the analysis
  - Analysis result will be printed based on filter citeria given by user
  - User would be requested to give consent inorder to view raw data
  - Procedure can be repeated over and over again as requested by user.
